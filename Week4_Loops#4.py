# Week 4 Loops #4

#  Write a program that generates the multiplication table for numbers 1-10.
#  Use two for loops to complete your program. You will need to put one for loop inside the other for loop.



for y in range(1, 10):
    for x in range(1, 10):
        print(x * y, end = '\t')
    print()
